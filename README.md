# MP-CBM-Z-v1.0
The Multiple Points Carbon Bond Mechanism Z (MP CBM-Z) is a gas-phase chemistry scheme based on CBM-Z by Zaveri et al., 1999. The MP CBM-Z adopted a new framework of code to adapt the single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) technology in next-generation processors to improve its calculation performance.
